## FMRI investigation of forming and updating person impressions

This repository contains code for analyzing fMRI data collected to study how people form and update impressions in
naturalistic contexts. Participants in this study were scanned listening to 3 stories about people. Each story was
split into two halves, each giving a postive or negative impression. Order of the story segments was manipulated so 
half the participants first developed a positive impression of the person and then updated it to a negative 
impression, whiel the second half of participants heard the story segments in the opposite order. 

The aim of the project is to compare neural responses while listening to the same segment of the story, but with 
different context background: forming a new impression or updating an impression.
